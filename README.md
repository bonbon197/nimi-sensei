# A quick note

It looks like Zira is being revived. This fork was created when Zira was shutting down with no real warning. You should probably use the [official repo](https://github.com/ZiraDiscord/Zira) / [instance](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=275813801792634880&permissions=268790848&scope=bot) ᵒʳ ʲᵘˢᵗ ᵘˢᵉ [ᵃᵗˡᵃˢ](https://atlasbot.xyz) ᵇᵉᶜᵃᵘˢᵉ ᶦᵗ ᶜᵃⁿ ᵈᵒ ʳᵉᵃᶜᵗᶦᵒⁿ ʳᵒˡᵉˢ ⁿᵒʷ ᵗᵒᵒ
